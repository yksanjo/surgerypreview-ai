## Email Template #1: Initial Cold Outreach

**Subject:** Free Patient Leads - SurgeryPreview Launch Partner

```
Dr. [Last Name],

I'm launching SurgeryPreview - a platform that pre-qualifies plastic surgery 
patients and matches them with NYC's top surgeons.

We scrape RealSelf, Zocdoc, and Healthgrades to identify high-intent patients, 
then match them with surgeons based on procedure, location, and ratings.

🎁 LAUNCH PARTNER OFFER:
- First 10 leads: 100% FREE
- After that: Only $75 when patient books consultation
- No upfront costs, no monthly fees, no contracts

WHY THIS WORKS:
✓ Patients come pre-qualified (photo, procedure, timeline, budget)
✓ You get exclusive access to hot leads before your competitors
✓ Average lead books within 48 hours (first responder wins)

RECENT RESULTS:
- 127 rhinoplasty consultations booked in December
- Average surgeon ROI: 12x (pays $75, earns $900+ per consultation)
- 89% of patients book with first surgeon to respond

Interested? I can send you 2-3 leads this week to test the quality.

Best,
Yoshi Sanjo

## Email Template #2: Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Re: Free Patient Leads - Quick Question

```
Dr. [Last Name],

Following up on my email from Monday about SurgeryPreview.

Quick question: Are you currently accepting new rhinoplasty patients?

I have 3 qualified leads this week:
- Sarah, 32, Manhattan, looking to refine bridge/tip
- Michael, 28, Brooklyn, post-injury correction  
- Jennifer, 35, UES, interested in natural results

Each patient has uploaded photos and is ready to book consultations.

Would you like me to send these leads your way? (First 10 are free)

Let me know and I'll get them to you today.

Best,
Yoshi

Hi Dr. [First Name],

Saw your impressive RealSelf profile (4.8 stars, 247 reviews!).

I'm building SurgeryPreview - think "Zillow for plastic surgery" - matching 
pre-qualified patients with top NYC surgeons.

Launch partner offer: First 10 patient leads free (normally $75/booking).

Interested in trying it? I can send 2-3 rhinoplasty leads this week to test 
the quality.

## Phone Script (If They Request a Call)

### Opening
"Hi Dr. [Name], this is Yoshi from SurgeryPreview. Thanks for taking my call. 
I know you're busy, so I'll be quick - this should take about 5 minutes. Sound good?"

### Pitch (60 seconds)
"SurgeryPreview solves a problem I'm sure you deal with: finding qualified 
patients who are serious about surgery.

Here's how it works:
1. Patients upload photos and tell us what they want (nose job, breast aug, etc.)
2. We match them with 3 surgeons based on specialty, location, and reviews
3. You get their contact info + photos, reach out within 24 hours
4. When they book a consultation, you pay us $75

The key difference from RealSelf or Zocdoc: these patients WANT to hear from you. 
They've already committed to the process by uploading photos.

Our early data shows 60-70% booking rate when surgeons respond within 1 hour."

### Objection Handling

**"I get enough patients from my website"**
→ "That's great! Most surgeons we work with use this as a supplement, not a 
replacement. The average surgeon books 2-3 extra procedures per month, which 
pays for itself 10x over. Want to try 5 free leads to see if it's worth it?"

**"$75 per lead seems expensive"**
→ "I totally understand. Keep in mind:
- RealSelf charges $200-500 per lead
- These are pre-qualified (photo uploaded, timeline set)
- You only pay when they BOOK, not just for the lead
- Average consultation converts to $8K-15K procedure
So really, $75 for a potential $10K patient is 0.75% cost of acquisition."

**"How do I know the quality is good?"**
→ "That's why I'm offering 10 free leads upfront. Test them yourself. If they're 
not high-quality, don't continue. No obligation."

**"I don't have time to respond to more leads"**
→ "Actually, these take less time because they're pre-qualified. You're not 
educating them from scratch - they've already researched the procedure. 
Most surgeons spend 2-3 minutes on initial outreach, then schedule 
15-minute phone consult. Much faster than cold RealSelf leads."

### Closing
"How about this: I'll send you 3 leads this week - completely free. You reach 
out to them, see what the quality is like. If you book even one consultation, 
that's proof of concept. If not, no harm done. Sound fair?"

→ Get commitment: "Great! What's the best email to send leads to? And what 
procedures are you most interested in?"
